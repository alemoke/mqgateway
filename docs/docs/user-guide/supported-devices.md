This is a list of devices currently supported by MqGateway. That means you can connect a device either with digital wires or through RS485/UART controller to MqGateway.

All supported devices need to be compatible with 5V power supply.

!!! danger
    Electricity can be very harmful!    
    Please do not connect anything to electricity yourself if you don't have enough knowledge, 
    and you are not completely sure what you are doing.   
    
!!! warning
    Information below has been provided as a pointer. I've tried to prepare it as accurately as I was able to. However, it may contain errors.
    Always check the device manual and do not connect electrical wires if you are not absolutely sure you know what you're doing.
    


### Digital devices

??? example "Wiring"
    Single button gate (garage door) is realized using electromechanical (EMR) relay module to emulate push button.
    Relay should be controlled with LOW signal.

    Between MqGateway and the relay module:
    
    | WIRE COLOR                           | RELAY PIN |
    |--------------------------------------|-----------|
    | orange (5V)                          | VCC / D+  |
    | orange-white (GND)                   | GND / D-  |
    | [any-digital](../hardware/wiring.md) | IN        |

    Relay module should be connected with COM and NO to the gate (garage door) opener in the place for connecting push button.  
    
    | RELAY CONNECTOR      |                        |

    | NC                   | nothing                |

    Three buttons gate (garage door) is realized using 3-channel electromechanical (EMR) relay module to emulate push button for each function. 
    Relay module should be controlled with LOW signal.
    
    Between MqGateway and the 3-channel relay module:
    
    | WIRE COLOR                           | RELAY PIN |

### Complex devices with RS485/UART Controller

This group of devices requires RS485/UART controller on the side of the device for communication with MqGateway. This controller might be 
any microcontroller which is able to communicate through RS485 or UART with 5V. Common choice is the Arduino Pro Mini board. 

More about how to connect and use complex devices with RS485/UART controller can be used in [complex devices page](../hardware/complex-devices.md)  

??? example "Wiring"
    Wiring between MqGateway and RS485/UART controller is the same for all devices below, but depends on the type of connection.
    For UART connection (without MAX485 on both sides)
